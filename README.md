# ActiveDirectory-Delegation
The goal is to use a golden source JSON file to delegate permissions to Active Directory OUs.

## Future Ideas
Want to add Windows Laps delegation
Want to add in reset inheritance switch
Want to create pester test cases to be able to audit that the OU has not drifted out of sync from the JSON golden source (our friendly rogue admins)
